# pollocraft

A continuation of ando's recommended _vanilla_ mods from previous Minecraft seasons. Focuses on improving stability and performance, adding QoL, and supporting the server's custom resource pack.

A couple of important notes:
* The modpack includes the custom resource pack
* Both the modpack and resource pack are self-updating once installed
* To enable auto-updates, the MultiMC Launcher is now ***required***

And if this sounds like too much work:
* The custom resource pack will work with any normal installation of Optifine
* The server is compatible with Vanilla Minecraft, so no mods are required to play at all

  > You'll just miss out on the fancy resource pack >:(

### Installation

1 - Download and run the [MultiMC Launcher](https://multimc.org).

2 - Download [pollocraft.zip](https://github.com/yungando/pollocraft/raw/main/MultiMC/pollocraft.zip) and drag it into the MultiMC window.

3 - MultiMC will check for updates whenever you launch the "pollocraft" instance.
